# Bill of Materials

This file lists part numbers and suppliers for components on this board.
The goal is to find the cheapest compatible sources, so that its easier 
for folks to build the board cost-effectively.

Also, some parts are only needed if you want particular ports to work.
If you don't need those ports, you may be able to skip some parts, and
save a bit of cost.
